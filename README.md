#About Me
* I want to achieve great things in life. I don't want my life to be boring and monotonous. I know how difficult the path from the desired to the actual. There is a lot to learn, to overcome obstacles and difficulties. And only after experiencing all this, we understand what a great pleasure it is to achieve our goal.
 My area of interest is varied. I try to develop comprehensively, so I am interested in many things: science, technology, psychology, philosophy, creativity and literature. I am ready to take on new projects and bring things to the end. I work well in a team, but I can also lead if necessary. I consider openness to everything new, flexibility of mind and interest in life as my strengths.
